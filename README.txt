This repository is an upgrade to my original budget tracker python script project.

This upgrade allows the user to interact with the budget tracker functions through the browser as a simple Flask web app

Please note dependancies required for running the script will be the flask and csv modules.
You may need to "pip3 install flask" in the venv or local directory.
